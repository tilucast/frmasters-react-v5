Just a quick observation about the usage of Redux:
I wanted to keep on the state the current selected type of animal, and the breeds of that specific animal, so the user can go back to the main page and not have to change the default animal (which is dog) to whatever other type of animal the user is interested on adopting, and of course, cache the results of the api.
It is very messy, but yeah, i wanted to do it with redux, and it is all type safe as well.
