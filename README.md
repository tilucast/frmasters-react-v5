Just a quick observation about the usage of Redux:
I wanted to keep on the state the current selected type of animal, and the breeds of that specific animal, so the user can go back to the main page and not have to change the default animal (which is dog) to whatever other type of animal the user is interested on adopting.
Yeah, it is too much code and effory to do something this simple, context would be better, but i wanted to use redux anyway.
